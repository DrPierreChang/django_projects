### Wisdom Pet Medicine

Project that manages pet adoptions.
A brand-new Django project was created, defining a data model and fields, querying the database, and using the framework's built-in URL handlers, views, and templates to structure the rest of the back end. Plus, CSS and JavaScript were incorporated  to enhance the style and usability of Django templates.
