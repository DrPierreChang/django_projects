Project that manages pet adoptions.
- How did i build it?

A brand-new Django project was created, defining a data model and fields, querying the database, and using the framework's built-in URL handlers, views, and templates to structure the rest of the back end. Plus, CSS and JavaScript were incorporated  to enhance the style and usability of Django templates.

Project was deployed on Amazon Lightsail with Apache
